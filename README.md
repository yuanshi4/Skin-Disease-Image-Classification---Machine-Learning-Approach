# Skin-Disease-Image-Classification---Machine-Learning-Approach
- We all know how strong neural network techniques(like CNN) are in such image recognition &amp; classification, even a person without many knowledge in data science may follow the codes &amp; packages people share online to perform such an analysis within hours. 

- I would like to try to take a different approach to perform image classification using only machine learning methods. In this project, I tested three classification machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine, and I am doing my best to collect features from image as variables to identify healthy and ill skin. 

- The result turns out to be quite accurate if using pixels as the image features, however, what if pixel is hard to understand by people in health industries? Can we use something else rather than pixel? This part is explored in Question 2. 


- Of course, this project, given a lot of limitation, takes effort, but I feel I had a deeper understanding of image classification.
