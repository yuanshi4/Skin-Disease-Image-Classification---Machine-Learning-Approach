# Skin-Disease-Image-Classification---Machine-Learning-Approach
We all know how strong neural network techniques(like CNN) are in such image recognition &amp; classification, even a person without many knowledge in data science may follow the codes &amp; packages people share online to perform such an analysis within hours. I would like to try to take a different approach to perform image classification using only machine learning methods. In this project, I tested three classification machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine, and I am doing my best to collect features from image as variables to identify healthy and ill skin. The result turns out to be quite accurate, off course it takes effort, but I feel I had a deeper understanding of image classification.
